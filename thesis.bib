	this particular environment in distributed manufacturing it is necessary
	to introduce new mechanisms to implement dynamic, distributed scheduling,
	specially to face disturbances. This paper presents an overview of
	the manufacturing scheduling problem and some techniques available
	to handle it. To solve the problem of stochastic, dynamic reaction
	to disturbances an adaptive control approach is described, based
	in the holonic manufacturing paradigm and the autonomy degree concept,
	which each operational holon uses to allow the balance between competition
	and cooperation.}},

An emulation system for a real material transport and handling production installation was implemented based on this. A prototype of a distributed production control system was run on top of the device emulation system to evaluate feasibility. A cardinal architectural principle is the clear distinction between production controllers and production devices.
